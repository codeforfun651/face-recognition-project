# Face Recognition Project

This project uses Python and the `face_recognition` library to detect and recognize faces from a webcam.

## Features
- Detects faces in real-time.
- Recognizes known faces from a folder of reference images.
- Can be integrated with a servo or relay for a smart door lock.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- face_recognition library

## Setup
1. Create a folder named `known_faces` in the project directory.
2. Add images of people you want to recognize.  
   - Each image should clearly show the personâ€™s face.  
   - You can add multiple images per person to improve accuracy.
